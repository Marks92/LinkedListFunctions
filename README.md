# LinkedListFunctions
10 Linked List functions in C

Program that creates 10 functions for a
linked list that holds two values, one is
a normal int value, the other being an int 
valid which declares whether the node is "valid"
when set to 1 or "not valid" when set to 0. Some
functions will "delete" valid nodes by setting int valid
to 0 and other functions will differentiate between valid 
and not valid nodes.
